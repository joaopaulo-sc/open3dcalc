/**
 * The hydration gate for the three migrated browser PII stores.
 *
 * ## Why a gate and not just `piiPersistStorage`
 *
 * `piiPersistStorage` (Wave 2) already refuses a locked read/write with a typed
 * `PiiStoreDeniedError`. That is necessary but not sufficient for the zustand
 * wiring, because zustand hydrates SYNCHRONOUSLY at store creation, at ES-module
 * evaluation time — before any React code, before the desktop bridge, and long
 * before a passphrase exists. The three stores therefore set
 * `skipHydration: true` and are rehydrated here, explicitly, after unlock.
 *
 * Two things are easy to get wrong without a single owner for that lifecycle:
 *
 *  1. **Hydrating too early.** If a store is rehydrated before the vault holds
 *     its key, the read refuses, zustand keeps the store's initial state, and a
 *     later write would persist that empty state over the user's real records.
 *     The gate refuses ANY write until that store has positively hydrated, so a
 *     not-yet-hydrated store cannot be the vector for the empty-array bug — even
 *     if a future caller forgets to wait for `rehydratePiiStores()`.
 *  2. **Hydrating and failing.** A failed hydration (unreadable record, refused
 *     key, malformed JSON) leaves the store at its initial state with no copy of
 *     the real data. Forwarding writes from that state would destroy the record
 *     the failure was hopefully recoverable from. On failure the gate drops the
 *     held key AND refuses writes, so the store is fail-closed rather than
 *     writable in a half-state.
 *
 * ## One choke point, not two
 *
 * The permission question ("may PII be read or written right now?") is answered
 * exactly once, by `piiStoreRefusalReason` in `piiStoreCapability.ts` — the same
 * predicate the vault's own operations use. This module only tracks hydration
 * state; when it refuses it asks that gate for the reason, so a locked vault
 * reports `profile_locked`, a declined user reports `consent_declined`, and so
 * on. No second predicate is introduced.
 *
 * ## The refused write is not silently dropped
 *
 * zustand's persist middleware calls `storage.setItem` from its wrapped `set`,
 * but a store ACTION ignores that returned promise (`set((s) => ...)`). A raw
 * rejection there is an unhandled rejection in every locked session. So the gate
 * attaches an internal no-op handler to the write promise and RETURNS THE SAME
 * STILL-REJECTING PROMISE: an awaiting caller sees the typed refusal, zustand's
 * orphaned promise is not an unhandled rejection, and the typed reason is
 * recorded in `getLastPiiWriteRefusal()` for the UI to surface. Nothing is
 * persisted and nothing is lost.
