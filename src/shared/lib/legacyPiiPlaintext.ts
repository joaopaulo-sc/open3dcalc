/**
 * Legacy plaintext PII detection (ADR-002 §2.2 quarantine).
 *
 * After the three browser PII stores migrate onto the encrypted vault, any
 * plaintext still sitting under their old `localStorage` keys is legacy residue:
 * data written before the vault existed. ADR-002 §2.2 requires that residue to
 * be detected and surfaced to the user, never silently migrated, never silently
 * deleted, and never implicitly accepted.
 *
 * This module is ONLY the detection half. It answers "is there legacy plaintext
 * PII, and how much?", so the migration/keep-read-only/export/delete choice can
 * render without doing any discovery of its own. It deliberately does not
 * implement the choice flow or a migration state machine — those are a later
 * wave with their own encrypted preimage and consent surface.
 *
 * ## Why reading plaintext is allowed here
 *
 * The fail-closed rule ("PII is neither read nor written when the vault is
 * unavailable") governs the VAULT path. Legacy detection is the explicit
 * exception: its whole purpose is to let a user see what residue exists before
 * choosing what to do with it, so it must be able to read the plaintext residue
 * even while the vault is locked. It reads COUNTS only — never record contents —
 * and returns nothing that can be rendered as PII.
