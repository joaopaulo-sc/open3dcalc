      // Vitest's own default for this pool is `testTimeout: 5000`; it was
      // previously left unconfigured here, so the budget was implicit.
      //
      // Why this number: the slowest measured test in the Electron/secret
      // family (electron/__tests__/{cryptoCapability,legacyRecovery,
      // legacyScan,osKeyring,persistGate,piiDomainTables,piiStage,
      // piiStageResidue}.test.ts) runs 2564-3331ms, i.e. 51-67% of that 5000ms
      // budget. 10s is ~3x the worst observation and above the 2x margin floor
      // (6662ms), which leaves room for a loaded CI runner.
      //
      // Scope, deliberately: `hookTimeout` and `teardownTimeout` are NOT set
      // here. The Electron family registers no beforeAll/afterAll, so the slow
      // work is test bodies, and teardown is not a hot spot — configuring a
      // knob with no consumer is noise. The 6781ms crypto self-test already
      // declares its own 180_000ms budget at the call site
      // (crypto.selftest.test.ts), so it needs no global margin.
      //
      // This is honest margin, NOT a flake fix: the reported flake did not
      // reproduce in 5 runs under load 2.99. Upstream vitest-dev/vitest#9751
      // ("Unify and simplify timeout configuration") documents how these knobs
      // are scattered across `testTimeout` / `expect.poll.timeout` /
      // `browser.providerOptions.actionTimeout` with no single place to reason
      // about them; this block is the single place for this repo.
